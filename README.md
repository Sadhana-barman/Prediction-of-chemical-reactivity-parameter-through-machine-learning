The complete dataset used in our article “Prediction of Chemical Reactivity Parameters via Data-driven Approach” is uploaded here.
This dataset contains chemical reactivity parameter values of various organic molecules and is prepared from a big database “Aires-de-Sousa, Joao; Latino, Diogo A.R.S. (2016). https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3384184.v1”. We have generated 202 chemical descriptors using RdKit software version 2024.09.4 for all organic molecules.
